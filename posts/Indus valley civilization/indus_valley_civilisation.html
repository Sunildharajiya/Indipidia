            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The Indus Valley Civilization, also known as the Harappan Civilization, was one of the earliest urban
                civilizations in the world, flourishing in the Indus River Valley from 3300 BCE to 1300 BCE. It was
                characterized by its advanced urban planning, sophisticated drainage systems, standardized weights and
                measures, and a unique writing system that remains largely undeciphered.</p>

            <h2>Geography</h2>
            <p>The civilization spanned a vast geographical area, encompassing parts of modern-day Pakistan, India, and
                Afghanistan. It was centered around the Indus River and its tributaries, which provided fertile land for
                agriculture and access to trade routes.</p>

            <img src="induscitys.jpg" width=100%>
            <p>The Indus Valley Civilization was known for its well-planned cities, such as Mohenjo-daro and Harappa.
                These cities were laid out on a grid system with wide streets, public squares, and elaborate drainage
                systems. The cities also featured fortified citadels, residential areas, and public buildings, including
                granaries, bathhouses, and temples.</p>

        <section id="society">
            <h2>Society</h2>
            <p>The Indus Valley Civilization was a complex society with a hierarchical structure. The ruling elite
                likely consisted of priests, merchants, and officials, while the majority of the population were
                farmers, artisans, and laborers. The society was organized around the concept of social harmony, and
                there is evidence of a strong emphasis on sanitation and public health.</p>

        <section id="culture">
            <h2>Culture</h2>
            <p>The Indus Valley Civilization had a rich and unique culture, evidenced by its art, crafts, and religious
                beliefs. The civilization is known for its exquisite craftsmanship, particularly in pottery, jewelry,
                and seals. The seals often feature animals and mythical creatures, suggesting a strong connection to
                nature and the supernatural.</p>

        <section id="decline">
            <h2>Decline</h2>
            <p>The Indus Valley Civilization began to decline around 1900 BCE, possibly due to a combination of factors,
                including climate change, environmental degradation, and invasion. The decline of the civilization led
                to the rise of new cultures and empires in the region.</p>

        <section id="legacy">
            <h2>Legacy</h2>
            <p>The Indus Valley Civilization has left a lasting legacy on the Indian subcontinent. Its innovations in
                urban planning, sanitation, and trade have influenced subsequent cultures and civilizations. The
                civilization's unique writing system, while largely undeciphered, continues to fascinate scholars and
                researchers.</p>
